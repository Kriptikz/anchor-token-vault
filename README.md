# anchor-token-vault

This exercise project is a simple spl-token vault using a PDA. A user can send some tokens to and withdraw from the vault.

The user can only withdraw the amount that they have deposited.

The tokens that can be deposited must be of the correct mint for that vault.

Initial implementation will be one vault for a single mint. 

Can experiment with more vaults of different mints after initial implementation.
